# Gimbap - 김밥
A small utility using [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) to prettify [C3's](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c) build system and to complement my laziness.

It’s small, cheap, delicious and never disappoints!

## Setup
**1.** Clone Gimbap and give it executable permissions.

**2.** Install [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).

**3.** Run Gimbap from terminal in the directory where you have your C3 project.

**4.** Enjoy your tasty Gimbap!

## Disclaimer
This tool shouldn't be taken seriously, honestly... It's just a small fun project I've done for myself with the required parameters I normally use.
You can always change them yourself if you feel like ever using this small tool.
