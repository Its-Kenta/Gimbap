# Gimbap - 김밥
A small utility using [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) to prettify [C3's](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c) build system and to complement my laziness. Now created in Crystal!

It’s small, cheap, delicious and never disappoints!

## Installation

**1.** Download the pre-built binary (linux only) or Clone Gimbap and build it from source.

**1.5 - Optional** Place Gimbap in /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin - depending on your distro) or add it to your path.

**2.** Install [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).

## Usage

**1.** Run Gimbap from terminal in the directory where you have your C3 project.

**2.** Enjoy your tasty Gimbap!

## Development

Go ham! Or don't. This project should never be taken seriously.
